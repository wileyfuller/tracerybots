# Tracery Bots

Some Tracery grammars for Twitter bots.

These are quite unsophisticated, but generally get the job done.

The bots have been deployed via https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/

* scottbot.json is tweeting at @ImABotScott
* sittingatacafebot.json is tweeting at @cafesittingbot
* mattcanavanbot.json is currently undeployed because it's too close to reality, and I haven't been bothered so far.
